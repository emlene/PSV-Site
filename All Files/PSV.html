        <h3><em><strong>About Campus</strong></em></h3></br>
        <p>PSU Rizal traces its early beginnings in 2000 by virtue of a Sangguniang
Bayan Resolution authored by late councilor Daniel Tacardon—the
Committee Chair on Education—requesting Palawan State University to
open the campus. The said resolution had earned the unanimous support
of the entire council under the gavel of former Vice-Mayor Wendelina
Usodan. The ate Mayor Samson Degillo commissioned some personnel
from his office to study the proposal and on that same year, the resolution
was approved paving the way for the much-awaited creation of Palawan
State University College of Community Resources Development Rizal
Campus. With the backing of Dr. Jesus Apdon, then Dean of CCRD
Campuses and the Vice President for Finance of Palawan State University
Desdichado Villasario and all other university officials, the Memorandum
of Agreement between the Local Government Unit of Rizal, the Parents and
Teachers Association, and the Palawan State University was finally signed
by Mayor Samson I. Degillo, PTA President Redemson Trongco and Dr.
Teresita L. Salva on the 22nd day of June 2000.

Finally, on June 05, 2000, after a series of meetings, the first class of the
local campus started under the directorship of Prof. Danilo Esmerio, who
served the local campus until 2007 under the shed of a borrowed vacated
municipal building of the local government at Tarampitao Point, a former

US Naval Base. Some classes were also held under the roof of the
dilapidated Long Range Aid to Navigation (LORAN) facility of the US Navy in
Tarampitao Point, particularly known today as Base, referring to the Naval
Base.

The campus remained as tenant in these facilities until the donation of the
old municipal building including the land area in favor of DEPED forced the
university to transfer to its new site at Sitio Balite which was donated by
the local government and the family of Renato Tabuzo. In November 2013,
the campus finally re-located its campus under the directorship of Prof.
Melodia Salimbagat. PSU Rizal received one unit of single-classroom
school building from then Congressman of the 2nd District of Palawan,
Atty. Victorino Dennis Socrates; another one unit of single-classroom
building from Congressman Eric Abueg; one unit of 4-classroom building
from Governor Jose Alvarez. Still during the stint of Prof. Salimbagat, the
local campus was able to build one unit of 4-classroom school building
funded under the fiduciary funds of the local campus. The local
government also added one unit of 2-classroom school building. Within the
span of three years, the Parents Teachers Association has also completed
and contributed one unit of single-classroom computer laboratory building.</p>
